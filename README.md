## About Me

I'm a Front-End Developer with over 3 years of experience building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Before transitioning to front-end development, I worked for 2 years as a Junior Quality Assurance Analyst, which gave me a strong foundation in software testing, attention to detail, and understanding of the full development lifecycle.

Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Para√≠ba (UFPB), where I'm deepening my knowledge in algorithms, systems design, and software engineering. I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient, and accessible user interfaces, and I'm always looking to grow as a developer through new challenges and technologies.
